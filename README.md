# Auxiliary Material for the course "Data and Image Analytics"

## Installation
There are two ways of setting up the environment for the course. The first one is using Poetry, a Python package manager. The second one is using pip. The first one is recommended as introduces virtual environments and dependency management, but the second one is easier to set up.
